# Chapter 24: Code Examples

This chapter is primarily conceptual, preparing you for the implementation in Chapter 25.

## Files in This Directory

### design_exercise.md
A sample solution for the practical exercise: designing an evaluator-optimizer system for product descriptions. This demonstrates how to create specific, measurable evaluation criteria and rubrics.

### conceptual_flow.py
A pseudocode/conceptual Python file showing the high-level structure of an evaluator-optimizer loop. This is NOT meant to be run—it's a blueprint for understanding the pattern before we implement it fully in Chapter 25.

## What's Coming in Chapter 25

In the next chapter, you'll implement:

1. A `Generator` class that creates and revises content
2. An `Evaluator` class that scores content against criteria
3. An `EvaluatorOptimizer` class that orchestrates the feedback loop
4. A complete working example: an iterative writing assistant

## Preparing for Implementation

Before moving to Chapter 25, make sure you understand:

- [ ] The generator-evaluator feedback loop
- [ ] How to design specific, measurable criteria
- [ ] Why stopping conditions are essential
- [ ] The tradeoffs between quality, latency, and cost

If you completed the design exercise in this chapter, you're ready for implementation!
