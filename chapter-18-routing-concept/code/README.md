# Chapter 18 Code Examples

This is a **concept and design** chapter focused on understanding routing patterns. The implementation code comes in Chapter 19.

## What's Here

- `design_template.md` - A template for the practical exercise (designing a documentation assistant router)

## Conceptual Code Snippets

The chapter includes several code snippets that illustrate concepts:

1. **Rule-based classification** - Pattern matching with keywords
2. **Handler interface pattern** - Abstract base class for route handlers
3. **Handler prompts** - Example system prompts for specialized handlers
4. **Confidence-based routing** - Thresholding for uncertain classifications
5. **Fallback handler** - Graceful error handling

These snippets are intentionally incomplete—they show the pattern without being runnable. Chapter 19 provides complete, runnable implementations.

## Practical Exercise

Use `design_template.md` to design a routing system for a documentation assistant. This design work prepares you for implementing a real router in Chapter 19.

## What's Next

See Chapter 19 for:

- Complete `Router` class implementation
- Working LLM-based classifier
- Specialized handler implementations
- Full test suite
