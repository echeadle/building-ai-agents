# Chapter 16: Code Examples

This chapter focuses on concepts and design rather than implementation. The code files here illustrate patterns and structures discussed in the chapter. Full implementations come in Chapter 17.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `chain_concepts.py` | Illustrative code showing chain structure and patterns |
| `quality_gates.py` | Example quality gate validators |
| `exercise_solution.md` | Solution to the chapter exercise |

## Note on Running Code

The code in this chapter is primarily conceptual—it demonstrates patterns rather than providing complete, runnable implementations. Chapter 17 provides the full implementation you can run.

If you want to run the quality gate examples, ensure you have the project set up per Chapters 2-4:

```bash
# Ensure you're in your project directory with .env configured
uv run python quality_gates.py
```
