## Next Steps

Once you complete all chapters:

1. **Review your notes** - Identify patterns you want to use
2. **Choose a project** - Pick a real-world problem to solve
3. **Design your agent** - Use Chapter 45's templates
4. **Build incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
5. **Test thoroughly** - Apply Chapter 35's testing patterns
6. **Deploy carefully** - Follow Chapter 40's deployment guide
7. **Monitor continuously** - Use Chapter 36's observability patterns
