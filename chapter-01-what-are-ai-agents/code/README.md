# Chapter 1: What Are AI Agents? - Code Examples

## No Code in This Chapter

This is a **conceptual chapter** that introduces the fundamental concepts of AI agents, the spectrum from simple prompts to autonomous agents, and the distinction between workflows and agents.

**Coding begins in Chapter 2** with environment setup and your first API call.

## What You'll Learn in Chapter 1

- The spectrum of LLM applications (prompts → conversations → tools → workflows → agents)
- The critical distinction between workflows (predetermined steps) and agents (dynamic decision-making)
- When to use agents vs. simpler approaches
- Real-world agent examples and architectures
- The agentic loop and the importance of state/memory

## Next Steps

Ready to start coding? Move on to **Chapter 2: Environment Setup** where you'll:
- Install Python 3.10+
- Set up `uv` package manager
- Configure your development environment
- Make your first API call to Claude

**Note**: While this chapter has no code, the concepts you learn here are foundational for everything that follows. Understanding when and why to build agents will save you from over-engineering (or under-building) your solutions.
